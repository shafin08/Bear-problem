# Description
A group of four (4) researchers are being chased by hungry polar bears around the North Pole late at night. They come to a rope bridge over a ravine. If they can all get over the bridge before the hungry polar bears arrive, they will survive.
At most two people can cross at a time. A person or pair of people can only cross when they have a flashlight with them. The group has only a single flashlight among them, so one person must bring the flashlight back across the bridge to the starting side before anyone else can cross.
Each person moves at a different pace:
• The Undergrad can cross the bridge in 1.5 minute
• The Grad Student can cross the bridge in 3 minutes • The Postdoc can cross the bridge in 7.5 minutes
• The Professor can cross the bridge in 10 minutes
